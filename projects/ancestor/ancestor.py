Example Input: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6)]
Starting node: 6
output: 1 (1 and 2 are tied but 1 has a lower id)

starting node: 1
output: -1 (1 has no ancestor)

Explanation: Starting at child ID 6, the earliest known ancestor will be parent ID 10, the one at the farthest distance from the input individual. Your ancestry will consist of ID individuals [1,3]->[2,3]->[3,6]->[5,6]->[5,7]->[4,5]->[4,8]->[8,9]->[11,8]->[10,1] --> 10


Plan
1. Translate the problem into graph terminology
Vertex - a person (in this case, we're given their IDs)
Edge - parent-child relationship between two people
Weights - not needed, all edges are equal and have no value/cost relted to them

2. Build your graph (use adjacency list)
Build a graph by using the parent-child relationships/edges we're givein (adjacency list from the input). Each node in the graph will have an outgoing/directed edge to tis parent/ancestor.

Key:Value of those keys
Parent:Child Key:Value

Starting individual ID:Earliest ancestor (will be a key in this dict but will have an empty set. No incoming edges)
{
    6: {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3}, {5}
}

3. Traverse your graph
We traverse the graph while keeping track of the node's distances from the starting and keep track of the terminal node with the lowest id and greatest distance. A terminal will have no outgiong edges, meaning it has no more ancestors. A terminal node doesn't mean it's the earliest ancestor though, so we need to consider the terminal node that is the greatest distance from the starting node (that also has the lowest id).

In this case, we can use Depth-First Traverse (DFT) to traverse all of the starting node's ancestors and return the earliest one with the lowest ID. Yes, it does matter waht type of traversal will work since we are trying to find the farthest ancestor in an ancestry tree. If we find that the node we're currently on doesn't have any incoming edges, then we've found the farthest ancestor. Need to traverse the entireity of the line. 

Clarifications:
* The input will not be empty.
* There are no cycles in the input.
* There are no "repeated" ancestors â€“ if two individuals are connected, it is by exactly one path.
* IDs will always be positive integers.
* A parent may have any number of children.

 Destination ancestor is Not a value/child in this graph
